<p>LLMs are proving themselves superbly capable of a variety of coding tasks, having been trained against the enormous amount of code, tutorials and manuals available online. However, with smaller languages like OCaml there simply isn't enough training material out there, particularly when it comes to new language features like <a href="https://ocaml.org/manual/5.3/effects.html">effects</a> or new packages that haven't had time to be widely used. With my colleagues <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/">Anil</a>, <a href="https://ryan.freumh.org/">Ryan</a> and <a href="https://toao.com/">Sadiq</a> we've been exploring ways to <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/notes/cresting-the-ocaml-ai-hump">improve this situation</a>. One way we can mitigate these challenges is to provide a Model Context Protocol (<a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io">MCP</a>) server that's capable of providing up-to-date info on the current state of the OCaml world.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/mcp">MCP specification</a> was released by Anthropic at the end of last year. Since then it has become an astonishingly popular mechanism for extending the capabilities of LLMs, allowing them to become incredibly powerful agents capable of much more than simply chatting. There are now a huge variety of MCP servers, from one that provides <a href="https://github.com/r-huijts/firstcycling-mcp">professional cycling data</a> to one that can <a href="https://github.com/GongRzhe/Gmail-MCP-Server">do your email</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers">awesome mcp server list</a> already lists hundreds, and these are just the <em>awesome</em> ones!</p>
<p>I've been working with <a href="https://toao.com/">Sadiq</a> to make an <a href="https://github.com/sadiqj/odoc-llm/">MCP server for OCaml</a>, with an initial focus on building it such that it can be hosted for everyone rather than something that is run locally. Our plan is to start with a service that can help with choosing OCaml libraries, by taking advantage of the work done by <a href="https://github.com/ocurrent/ocaml-docs-ci/">ocaml-docs-ci</a> which is the tool used to generate the documentation for all packages in <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/opam-repository">opam-repository</a> and is served by <a href="https://ocaml.org/">ocaml.org</a>. As well as producing HTML docs, we can also extract a number of other formats from the pipeline, including a newly created <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/odoc/pull/1341">markdown backend</a>. Using this, we can get markdown-formatted documentation for the every version of every package in the OCaml ecosystem.</p>
<h2><a href="https://jon.recoil.org/atom.xml#semantic-searching" class="anchor"></a>Semantic searching</h2>
<p>The first thing we focused on was being able to do a <em>semantic search</em> over the whole OCaml ecosystem. To do this, we're using <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/hesamation/primer-llm-embedding">LLM embeddings</a>, for which we need some natural-language description to seach through.</p>
<p>The documentation produced by <code>ocaml-docs-ci</code> is generated per library module using <a href="https://github.com/ocaml/odoc">odoc</a>, relying on the package author to provide documentation comments for each element in the signature. However, even if the package authors <em>hasn't</em> provided any documentation, we can still see the types, values, modules and so on that the library exposes, and this is often enough to get a good idea of what the module does. We then take these documentation pages, which are formatted in markdown, and summarise them via an LLM at the module level. This is done hierarchically, so we start with the 'deepest' modules, and then insert their summaries into the text of their parent module, then summarise those and so on. We found it useful to include the names and <a href="https://ocaml.github.io/odoc/odoc/odoc_for_authors.html#preamble">preambles</a> of the ancestor modules when doing the summarisation to give additional context to the LLM. For example, here is the prompt generated for a submodule of the <a href="https://erratique.ch/software/astring">astring</a> library:</p>
<div><pre class="language-markdown"><code>Module: Astring.String.Ascii

Ancestor Module Context:
- Astring: Alternative `Char` and `String` modules. Open the module to
use it. This defines one value in your scope, redefines the `(^)`
operator, the `Char` module and the `String` module. Consult the
differences with the OCaml `String` module, the porting guide and a
few examples.
- Astring.String: Strings, `substrings`, string sets and maps. A
string `s` of length `l` is a zero-based indexed sequence of `l`
bytes. An index `i` of `s` is an integer in the range [`0`;`l-1`], it
represents the `i`th byte of `s` which can be accessed using the
string indexing operator `s.[i]`.
Important. OCaml's `string`s became immutable since 4.02. Whenever
possible compile your code with the `-safe-string` option. This module
does not expose any mutable operation on strings and assumes strings
are immutable. See the porting guide.

Module Documentation: US-ASCII string support.
References.

## Predicates
- val is_valid : string -&gt; bool (* `is_valid s` is `true` iff only for
  all indices `i` of `s`, `s.[i]` is an US-ASCII character, i.e. a
  byte in the range [`0x00`;`0x7F`]. *)

## Casing transforms
The following functions act only on US-ASCII code points that is on
bytes in range [`0x00`;`0x7F`], leaving any other byte intact. The
functions can be safely used on UTF-8 encoded strings; they will of
course only deal with US-ASCII casings.

- val uppercase : string -&gt; string (* `uppercase s` is `s` with
  US-ASCII characters `'a'` to `'z'` mapped to `'A'` to `'Z'`. *)
- val lowercase : string -&gt; string (* `lowercase s` is `s` with
  US-ASCII characters `'A'` to `'Z'` mapped to `'a'` to `'z'`. *)
- val capitalize : string -&gt; string (* `capitalize s` is like
  `uppercase` but performs the map only on `s.[0]`. *)
- val uncapitalize : string -&gt; string (* `uncapitalize s` is like
  `lowercase` but performs the map only on `s.[0]`. *)

## Escaping to printable US-ASCII
- val escape : string -&gt; string (* `escape s` is `s` with: *)
- val unescape : string -&gt; string option (* `unescape s` unescapes
  what `escape` did. The letters of hex escapes can be upper, lower or
  mixed case, and any two letter hex escape is decoded to its
  corresponding byte. Any other escape not defined by `escape` or
  truncated escape makes the function return `None`. *)
- val escape_string : string -&gt; string (* `escape_string s` is like
  `escape` except it escapes `s` according to OCaml's lexical
  conventions for strings with: *)
- val unescape_string : string -&gt; string option (* `unescape_string`
  is to `escape_string` what `unescape` is to `escape` and also
  additionally unescapes the sequence `"\\'"` (`0x5C,0x27`) to `"'"`
  (`0x27`). *)</code></pre></div>
<p>where clearly the package author has provided excellent documentation comments. This is then passed to an LLM which generated the following description:</p>
<div><pre class="language-ocaml"><code>This module provides functions to check if a string contains only
US-ASCII characters, convert case for ASCII letters, and escape or
unescape strings using ASCII conventions. It operates on standard
OCaml strings, treating them as sequences of bytes, and ensures
compatibility with UTF-8 encoded strings when transforming case. Use
cases include sanitizing input for ASCII-only protocols, preparing
strings for environments requiring strict ASCII formatting, and
handling escaped string representations in configuration or
serialization contexts.</code></pre></div>
<p>Once we have these natural language descriptions, we can generate embeddings for them to allow for semantic search amongst all modules in opam.</p>
<p>In addition to the module descriptions, we also generate similar natural-language descriptions of the <em>package</em> as a whole, by taking the README from the package and summarising it similarly. Where there is no README, we summarise the summaries of the modules of the libraries, so we're always able to generate some text description of the entire package.</p>
<p>To help with the ranking, we're also using a measure of popularity for both modules and packages. For packages, we're using the number of reverse dependencies in opam as a proxy for popularity, and for modules, we're using the "occurrences" generated as part of the docs build. These [occurrences] are a count of how often modules are used in other modules, and are calculated by looking at the compiled [cmt] files and resolving references to external modules using odoc's internal logic and counting them.</p>
<p>Once we have both the module and package summaries, we generate an embedding of the descriptions to allow for a semantic search to be performed efficiently. We're using this in two ways - to search for packages for broad queries of functionality, which just uses the package summaries, and for more specific queries to search for modules within packages.</p>
<p>For the module search, if the packages to search in haven't been specified, we search for both modules and packages and then combine the results. This is particularly helpful when the search is for generic functionality that might be found in more specific packages. For example, a module-only search for the term "time and date manipulation functions" returns the strongest match with a <a href="https://ocaml.org/p/caqti/2.2.4/doc/caqti.platform/Caqti_platform/Conv/index.html">module from caqti</a>, which, as caqti is a library for talking to relational databases, might not be what the user is looking for.</p>
<p>We then put these search tools into an MCP server, along with a little more functionality. The server currently provides these five functions:</p>
<ol><li>Search for OCaml packages</li><li>Search for OCaml modules (optionally within packages)</li><li>Get the summary description of a package</li><li>Get the raw Markdown docs for a module (optionally within a package)</li><li>Search using sherldoc</li></ol>
<p>The first 2 use the LLM-generated summaries as described above, and the last is using <a href="https://github.com/art-w/">Arthur's</a> <a href="https://github.com/art-w/sherlodoc">sherlodoc tool</a> which can do various searches, including type-based search, across the output of the <a href="https://github.com/ocurrent/ocaml-docs-ci">ocaml-docs-ci</a>.</p>

<h2><a href="https://jon.recoil.org/atom.xml#limitations-and-future-work" class="anchor"></a>Limitations and future work</h2>
<p>We're aware that there are currently a number of limitations with what's been done so far, and there's a lot of exciting things that could quite easily be added!</p>
<p>We haven't done much prompt optimisation either for the tools themselves, nor their descriptions in the MCP server. We also haven't done much optimisation of the information retrieval - and it's clear from some of the results shown above that there are improvements to be made in the ranking algorithms. Some obvious next steps would be to do some <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2406.12433v2">re-ranking</a> or some form of hybrid search.</p>
<p>A particular challenge is that since this is based entirely off of the <code>ocaml-docs-ci</code> build, it won't necessarily reflect the actual API your local build, as for OCaml, this <a href="https://jon.recoil.org/blog/2025/04/semantic-versioning-is-hard.html">can't be done</a>. Thibaut Mattio is working on a <a href="https://github.com/tmattio/ocaml-mcp">local MCP server</a> that would be perfectly positioned to do some of what we're doing, although we'd need to have a good local docs build implemented in dune for this to work well.</p>
<p>Also, there's plenty more data that we've collected during the docs builds! We can show the implementations of functions, we can expose code samples, select different versions of packages and much more. While we've concentrated on the search aspects, there's still a lot of low-hanging fruit that can be worked on.</p>
<p>If you're interested in helping us out on this, the project lives <a href="https://github.com/sadiqj/odoc-llm">on github</a> - come along and join us!</p>
<h2><a href="https://jon.recoil.org/atom.xml#using-the-server" class="anchor"></a>Using the server</h2>
<p>If you'd like to try it, we've got a demo server running right now. It's hosted on dill.caelum.ci.dev here at the Computer Laboratory in the University of Cambridge. To enable it with Claude, try this:</p>
