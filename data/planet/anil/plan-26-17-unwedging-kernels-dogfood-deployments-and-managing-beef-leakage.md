<p>After the <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/notes/2026w16">travel marathon</a> of the past fortnight I got to catch up with hacking this week! I did pop down to London once for a Royal Society <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/notes/rs-eu-ai-science">policy meeting on AI in science with the European Commission</a> and discovered that the EU still has a (much-shrunken) <a href="https://www.eeas.europa.eu/delegations/united-kingdom_en?s=3225">delegation</a> in London; a bit of post-Brexit infrastructure that I hadn't appreciated existed but am very glad to hear about.</p>
<p>While I was down there, I caught up with <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~comar/">Cyrus Omar</a> who was over from Michigan to chat about our <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/papers/2025-fairground">Fairground</a> <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/projects/enki">planetary wiki</a> work. We're both interested in how programmable wikis can become a serious substrate for sharing structured scientific data with provenance baked in, and PROPL 2026 is coming up in PLDI where we'll do more work on this.</p>
<h2><a href="https://anil.recoil.org/news.xml#welcoming-akshay-to-cambridge" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"></a>Welcoming Akshay to Cambridge</h2>
<p>I'm most delighted to welcome <a href="https://oppi.li/">Akshay Oppiliappan</a> to my group here in Cambridge! I've
long been a fan of his work on <a href="https://tangled.org">Tangled</a>, and indeed
consider it to be <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/notes/atproto-for-fun-and-blogging">the most useful app built over ATProto</a>.</p>
<p>We've been <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/notes/tangled-and-ci">using Tangled</a> for a lot of our <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/notes/disentangling-git-with-bluesky">code hosting</a> here in my
group, and it's a really practical way to get towards some of the things we
want to do for building federated scientific infrastructure under the <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/notes/principles-for-collective-knowledge">five principles of collective knowledge</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://anil.recoil.org/images/welcome-akshay.webp" alt="%c" title="Akshay, Jon, Mark and me hang out in my jungle"></p>
<p>One interesting thing I learnt is that Tangled is working on a separable
'app view' (that is, a version of the <a href="https://tangled.org">https://tangled.org</a> website that can
be deployed elsewhere). I'd love to have a version that is restricted to just the
immediate group members in order to help get a focussed view on a particular
set of repositories, while still keeping the overall metadata open.</p>
<h2><a href="https://anil.recoil.org/news.xml#tessera-aws-sync-done-zarr-bindings-next" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"></a>TESSERA: AWS sync done, Zarr bindings next</h2>
<p>The big milestone on the <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/projects/tessera">TESSERA</a> side is that the <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/notes/2026w16">AWS Open Data sync</a> has finally finished, so we now have the full half-petabyte mirrored alongside our <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/notes/2026w14">Cambridge Ceph</a> copy. With that done, I'm turning my attention to the OxCaml Zarr conversion by building on Mark's <a href="https://github.com/mtelvers/ocaml-zarr">ocaml-zarr</a> work, so that we can start consuming the cloud-native stores directly via HTTP.</p>
<p>There are also some exciting updates coming soon about a new version of the
TESSERA model that pushes the embedding quality further. The nice property of
how we've architected "embeddings as data" is that no user-facing code will need to
change when v1.1 lands. We just regenerate the map tiles under the existing
<a href="https://anil.recoil.org/notes/tessera-embeddings-convention">geo-embeddings convention</a> and downstream
tasks should pick up the improvements automatically. More on this once the
embeddings generation progresses!</p>
<h2><a href="https://anil.recoil.org/news.xml#recoil-refresh-to-linux-70" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"></a>Recoil refresh to Linux 7.0</h2>
<p>On the home infrastructure front, I spent some quality time upgrading several of the <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/notes/decentralised-stack">Recoil self-hosting</a> machines to <strong>Ubuntu 26.04</strong>. I have <strong>not</strong> been able to recreate the pesky <a href="https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/issues/16133">io_uring/zfs wedge</a> that has been plaguing me even on 6.14 kernels recently. Fingers crossed that it really is fixed and not just hiding behind a race condition!</p>
<p>I've also been happily using <a href="https://komo.do/">Komodo</a> as the lightweight web interface for Docker across three machines, and am busy migrating to Mythic Beasts since our former Equinix hosting is <a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/equinix-to-kill-off-metal-by-june-2026/">sunsetting</a> next month. The only technical complexity here is that <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/admin/migrating/">Mastodon is tied to one hostname</a> and I made a mistake calling it <a href="https://amok.recoil.org">amok.recoil.org</a> (the raw hostname) instead of something more abstract. <a href="https://mynameismwd.org">Michael Dales</a> did <a href="https://digitalflapjack.com/weeknotes/2025-03-31/">manage to migrate</a> last year though, which is a good sign when I try next week...</p>
<h2><a href="https://anil.recoil.org/news.xml#oi-continues-and-now-deploys-this-very-site" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"></a>oi continues, and now deploys this very site</h2>
<p>My sidequest on <a href="https://github.com/avsm/oi"><strong>oi</strong></a>, my <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/notes/2026w16">uv-like distributor for OCaml binaries</a>, has been steadily gaining steam. It now supports <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/projects/oxcaml">OxCaml</a> as well as multiple OCaml versions, which is tricky since OxCaml isn't relocatable yet. Still, some hacks later, I've got far enough that I'm quietly using it for myself day-to-day to see if the tool holds up under real development workloads.</p>
<p>This very website is now deployed using:</p>
<pre><code>oi run --toolchain=oxcaml @avsm/arod -- arod serve -v
</code></pre>
<p>This feels like a nice eating-my-own-dogfood moment! I'll write up technical
details properly once I've stopped rewriting the implementation.</p>
<p>I've also been working with <a href="https://github.com/samoht">Thomas Gazagnaire</a> to merge his significant changes from the
last four months into the <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/notes/aoah-2025">agentic libraries</a> I built last year, so
we can reconcile our diverging trees. He's been hacking on these in his
<a href="https://tangled.org/gazagnaire.org/monopampam">monopampam</a> tree and there's a
lot of cleanup to bring across.</p>
<h3><a href="https://anil.recoil.org/news.xml#cross-building-ocaml-windows-binaries" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"></a>Cross-building OCaml Windows binaries</h3>
<p>Apropos to the above, I've been poking at
<a href="https://github.com/msys2/msys2-docker">msys2-docker</a> to see if I could compile
OCaml Windows binaries directly from Linux without doing full
cross-compilation. It does <em>almost</em> work but the layering of MSYS2 inside Wine
is unreliable due to fork not working very well. <a href="https://dave.recoil.org">Dave Scott</a> then mentioned to me
over a coffee that it's possible to do this more directly via Wine running
<code>cmd.exe</code>, by extracting the necessary bits out of a <code>nanoserver</code> Docker image.
That sounds way better, so I'll try that approach next week.</p>
<h2><a href="https://anil.recoil.org/news.xml#a-new-forest-leakage-preprint" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"></a>A new forest leakage preprint</h2>
<p>A new preprint has gone up from our <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/projects/4c">4C</a> trusted carbon credits work, led by the wonderful <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1684-0277">Francisco d'Albertas</a>.</p>
<p>This one's about <a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-9440067/v1">"Estimating the carbon impacts of leakage from forest restoration and the costs of reducing them"</a>. The abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ecosystem restoration is a key nature-based climate solution but risks
displacing economic activities and triggering leakage – whereby forgone
production drives habitat loss elsewhere, eroding benefits. Focusing on
reforestation opportunities Brazilian ranchland we characterized leakage risk
as the ratio of forgone beef production to carbon gained.</p>
<p>Assuming 100% of forgone production results in extensification we asked: what
is the impact of unaddressed leakage; how much can leakage be reduced by
prioritizing restoration in low-yielding, high-carbon areas; and can it be
cost-effectively mitigated by targeted intensification?</p>
<p>Taking likely leakage into account but
not tackling it increased median costs of restoration (over ignoring it
entirely) by 43-100%, to median values of 33 and 24 USD tCO₂e⁻¹ in the Atlantic
Forest and Amazon, respectively. Prioritizing low-leakage sites reduced these
costs by 21–37%; combining this with targeted intensification cut net carbon
costs further, to 67% of unmitigated levels. Our broad findings hold at 30%
(cf 100%) extensification and in other sensitivity analyses, and reveal
leakage can substantially increase carbon costs, but that careful siting and
targeted intensification can provide extremely cost-effective mitigation.

<p>This pushes our <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/papers/2025-forest-restoration-cc">forest restoration</a> analyses onto the all-important "leakage" question, which is something of an elephant in the room for almost any nature-based climate intervention (if we choose our interventions badly, then displacement of existing use of that land causes yet more deforestation).
