title: 'AoAH Day 24: Tuatara, an evolving Atom aggregator that mutates'
description: Tuatara is a feed aggregator that integrates Claude to evolve and patch
  its own code when encountering parsing errors, embodying the concept of self-healing
  software.

<p>My original purpose for starting this <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/notes/aoah-2025">AoAH</a> series was to build a
feed aggregator for my group website, so I had to finish up with something to show!</p>
<p>I'm not sure if taking the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/6001-think-you-re-escaping-and-run-into-yourself-longest-way-round">longest way around</a>
was wise here but I ended up building <strong><a href="https://tangled.org/anil.recoil.org/tuatara">tuatara</a></strong>, an
aggregator to pull together all my colleagues' writing into one place.
They're a quirky bunch with many diverse homegrown feeds in various
states of brokenness, so it's difficult to build a one-size-fits-all tool.</p>
<p>So given it's the end of the year and I'm sozzled on Christmas eve on
mulled wine, I decided to make Tuatara <strong>mutate its own code</strong> by linking with my <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/notes/aoah-2025-4">Claudeio</a> library to
force it to evolve and modify itself as it runs across feed errors. Every deployment of
Tuatara is meant to be slightly <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/papers/2025-internet-ecology">different</a>.</p>

<p>The initial generation of the code was pretty straightforward, using Sqlite to
store a database with all the posts and importing metadata from my previously
created <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/notes/aoah-2025-8">Sortal</a> contacts manager.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&gt; tuatara import-sortal
Sortal Import Results:

  Total contacts scanned: 420
  Contacts with feeds: 15
  Feeds imported: 16
  Feeds skipped (already exist): 0

Run 'tuatara fetch' to download posts from the imported feeds.

<p>But when we actually get the feeds, I rapidly realised that there are lots of
parsing quirks needed:</p>

<p>Either we skip content, or talk to the people involved to fix their feeds, but
it's Christmas eve so that's unlikely. And anyway, we want to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle">liberal in
what we accept</a> so why
can't I fix my own software first?!</p>
<p><img src="https://anil.recoil.org/images/aoah-tuatara-ss-1.webp" alt="%c" title="Like the amazing Tuatara, why don't we build evolution directly into our software? Time to take off the semantics seatbelt..."></p>
<h2><a href="https://anil.recoil.org/news.xml#medice-cura-te-ipsum" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"></a>Medice, cura te ipsum</h2>
<p>The non-obvious and probably-terrible answer here is to use our fancy coding
models to force the Tuatara source code to heal itself.  I added an <code>--evolve</code>
flag to allow tuatara to invoke <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/notes/aoah-2025-4">Claude/OCaml</a> upon errors and patch its own code.
Turns out self help works, as Martin's blog feed was just fine!</p>

  Error: Feed parse error: document MUST contains exactly one &lt;feed&gt; element at l.0 c.0
  URL: http://feeds.feedburner.com/martinkl

Invoking Claude Code to fix parse error...

The feed from `http://feeds.feedburner.com/martinkl` is an **RSS 2.0 feed** (it
starts with `&lt;rss version="2.0"&gt;`), but tuatara was incorrectly detecting it as
an **Atom feed**. This caused the Syndic Atom parser to fail with "document
MUST contains exactly one \&lt;feed\&gt; element".

The root cause was that the `detect_feed_type` function prioritized the HTTP
`Content-Type` header over the actual content. FeedBurner (and other feed
aggregators) often serve RSS feeds with an incorrect `application/atom+xml`
content-type header.

This is a generic fix that will work for any feed aggregator or CDN that
mis-labels RSS feeds as Atom (or vice versa), so no domain-specific quirk was
needed.
</code></pre>
<p>But the parsing drama continued, as <a href="https://mynameismwd.org">Michael Dales</a> uses the wrong date format in his
feed (tsk tsk I'd send the RFC police out if it wasn't Christmas), but Tuatara
<a href="https://tangled.org/anil.recoil.org/tuatara/commit/a56c4a877936a1ae49c0fab301fb6afbcc74b3bb">evolves a quirk</a> that gets past it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The quirk module converts ISO 8601 dates (2025-10-22T12:24:00-00:00) to RFC
822 format (Wed, 22 Oct 2025 12:24:00 GMT) which is what Syndic's RSS2 parser
expects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And <a href="https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/people/og309">Onkar Gulati</a> and <a href="https://patrick.sirref.org">Patrick Ferris</a> both have an empty author field which would
ordinarily give us a dreaded <code>Not_found</code> exception:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fetching Patrick Ferris...Error: Feed parse error: <entry> elements MUST contains at least an <author> element or <feed> element MUST contains one or more <author> elements at l.1460 c.7 URL: http://patrick.sirref.org/weeklies/atom.xml</author></feed></author></entry></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But never fear, the inexorable <code>--evolve</code> flag figures it out and patches its own code!</p>
<p>There were some non-trivial quirks as well; <a href="https://ancazugo.github.io/">Andres Zuñiga-Gonzalez</a> uses Quatro for his website which puts the entire HTML blob into the summary field, but the evolution managed to use <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/notes/aoah-2025-15">html5rw</a> to parse <a href="https://tangled.org/anil.recoil.org/tuatara/commit/7f29b37e1c647f984589e42164a0fc2ec0cda5c4">its way out of this</a>. This sort of fix is very hard to generalise, so it's actually quite useful for the tool to fix itself on demand for our small group.</p>

<p>Then I needed a quick way to do a clean frontend output so I can visualise the
JSONfeed. Claude has a <code>/plugin frontend-design</code> skill that is built in, and
prompting it to give me a few designs let me integrate a <code>--html</code> output.</p>
<p>And because it's Christmas, I added some snowflakes as well. Yay!</p>

<h2><a href="https://anil.recoil.org/news.xml#reflections" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"></a>Reflections</h2>
<p>The paper I enjoyed writing the most this year was <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/papers/2025-internet-ecology">Steps towards an Ecology for the Internet</a> for
<a href="https://anil.recoil.org/notes/ecology-at-aarhus">Aarhus 2025</a>. In the back of my head since has been a desire
to start figuring out what self-evolving software actually might be. It's a
strange, and probably impractical idea, but I'm delighted that I took a tiny
step towards it with this project.</p>
<p>Back in March, I had the honour of being invited to a <a href="https://bellairs.net">Bellairs</a> meeting to discuss a heady combination of semantics and computational science. <a href="https://jonmsterling.com">Jon Sterling</a> demonstrated his wonderfully organised Forester website. And I... showed how my mismash of semi-structured writings can kind of be connected together in a vaguely coherent way to build my website. Next year will have me thinking much harder about the implications of <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/papers/2025-internet-ecology">self-evolving code</a>, of how radically <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/papers/2025-biodiversity-9recs">transformative to global biodiversity</a> semi-structured agentic processing might be, and other heavy matters. But to close this year, I'm disproportionately pleased to have gotten my tiny website under control a little!</p>

<p>As I noted in my <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/notes/acm-ai-recs">letter to the ACM</a>, it's important that we can use AI for things that boost the
human condition; I really enjoy reading my colleagues' long form thoughts much
more than doomscrolling on the web, and so making it easier to gather their
thoughts digestibly and easily is a nice end to my <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/notes/aoah-2025">agentic humps</a>
effort. Tomorrow on <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/notes/aoah-2025-25">Christmas</a> I'll publish all the skills I used so others can try them out.</p><h1>References</h1><ul><li>Madhavapeddy et al (2025).
